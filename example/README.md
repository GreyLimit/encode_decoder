Here an example use of encode_decoder:  These files represent a description of the AVR instruction set, and the corresponding decoder generated.

These file have not been used in anger yet, but show the intended purpose of this program.

usage:
```
encode_decoder AVR_CPU.txt
```
This will generate the files 'AVR_CPU.h' and 'AVR_CPU.cpp'.

This example file is now "complete", but untested, and certainly not a complete AVR simulation.  It's purpose is really just to show how I thnk the encode_decoder processor can be usefully applied.  That being said, this is a rather long file.

I will start a separate project for AVR Simulator, soon.
