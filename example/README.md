Here an example use of encode_decoder:  These files represent a description of the AVR instruction set, and the corresponding decoder generated.

These file have not been used in anger yet, but show the intended purpose of this program.

usage:

encode_decoder AVR_Instructions.txt > AVR_Decoder.cpp

The AVR_Decode.h file needs to be hand crafted to suit.
